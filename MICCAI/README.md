### Notes

The same `.nii.gz` files and the same random seed as in 
[DAGAN](https://github.com/nebulaV/DAGAN/blob/master/data/MICCAI13_SegChallenge/dataset_name_list.txt) are used to select training and test images.

However, I found that, the number of training images, 
as well as PSNR and NMSE of the zero-filled test images, 
are slightly different from what were stated in [DAGAN paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8233175).
